        Web application developer
      </h3>
      <p class="italic text-gray-600 mt-2">
        I’m a passionate and results-driven Full Stack Developer with over 4
        years of hands-on experience building robust, scalable web applications
        using modern technologies. My core expertise lies in the MEAN stack —
        Angular, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB — with strong proficiency in
        NestJS and RESTful APIs. Throughout my career, I’ve developed
        feature-rich applications, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and
        delivered high-quality software with clean, maintainable code.

        <br />I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and constantly
        seek opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it’s building front-end
        interfaces or architecting efficient back-end services, I bring
        attention to detail, performance, and user experience into every project
        I work on.
